- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jkfields
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in anything Python.  It is my favorite development tool, and I utilize it as much as possible.  I had a very specialized job in a tightly controlled computing environment, so the code I write typically runs on older python distributions, and I have very limited ability to add/use modules outside the baseline distribution.  As a result, I create a lot of simplified code to work around that limitation.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning R and Rust.
