- 👋 Hi, I’m @jkfields
- 👀 I’m interested in anything Python.  It is my favorite development tool, and I utilize it as much as possible.  I have a very specialized job in a rigid environment, so the code I write typically runs on older python distributions and I have very limited ability to add/use modules outside the baseline distribution.  As a result, I create a lot of simplified code to work around that limitation.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use 'namedtuple' to create small 'databases' for static information which is another unique feature of the systems I support.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything python related.
- 📫 Contact me at jkfields at yahoo.
